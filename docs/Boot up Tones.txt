Accessible GD77 Boot Up Tones
By Chris ve3rwj

If you want to change the GD77 start up tones, launch the AccessibleGD77 CPS, go to the Extras Menu with ALT+E, then O for Open GD77 Support.
SHIFT+TAB a couple times and you will discover an edit field with some numbers in it and a Play Tune button. The numbers are read as comma-delimited pairs.
the first number is the pitch, the second number is the duration. Use 0 in the pitch spot for silence. 1 gets you second octave A, and each increment gives
you half a step (one semitone) up. 4 is third octave C, 16 is "middle C", 28 is fifth octave C... 40 is 6th octave C, etc. 

Below are many, many Tunes You Can Simply Copy and Paste into the edit field.
If you'd rather spell out something in CW instead, here are a couple examples of that.
Someone's Callsign:
0,3,38,2,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,6,0,6,38,2,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,6,0,6,38,6,0,2,38,2,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,2,0,6,38,6,0,2,38,2,0,2,38,6,0,2,38,6,0,6
Or this. Can you tell what it says just by looking at the numbers?
