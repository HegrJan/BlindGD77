# OpenGD77
Firmware for DMR transceivers using the NXP MK22 MCU, AT1846S RF chip and HR-C6000 DMR chipset.  
Including the Radioddiy GD-77 and GD-77S, the TYT MD-760 and TYT MD-730, the Baofeng DM-1801, DM-1801A, DM-860, RD-5R and DM-5R Tier2.

# Project status

The firmware is relatively stable and provides DMR and FM audio transmission and reception, as well as a DMR hotspot mode.  
However it does not support some core functionality that the official firmware supports, including sending and receiving of text / SMS messages

The firmware source code does not contain a AMBE codec required for DMR operation.  
This functionality is provided by the official firmware which is merged with the OpenGD77 by the firmware loader
